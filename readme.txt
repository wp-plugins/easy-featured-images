Allows you to add and remove featured images from admin post lists. Works with AJAX and magic for your image assignment pleasure.

== Description ==

Easy Featured Images allows you to assign featured images to posts much more efficiently, especially if you have a number of posts to go through. Normally you have to visit the edit page of each post, launch the media window and upload/assign the image.

With the plugin enabled you can do this from the post list screen. Everything words via AJAX so images are assigned instantly, without having to wait for pages to load. It uses the regular WordPress media box making the plugin 100% WordPress awesome.

Easy Featured Images also support **WooCommerce**, yay!

You can use the `efi/post_types` filter to modify the array of post types that the plugin's functionality is assigned to. Return the final list of post types you want the plugin to be applied to:

`add_filter( 'efi/post_types', 'my_post_type_images' );
function my_post_type_images( $post_types ) {
    unset( $post_types['page'] );
}`
